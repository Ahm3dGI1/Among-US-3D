# 3D Among Us - Training Project

**Project Description:** This project is a work-in-progress 3D version of Among Us, created as a training project on Unity3D. The game aims to replicate the gameplay and mechanics of the popular social deduction game, allowing players to navigate a 3D environment, complete tasks, and identify impostors.

## Technical Highlights

Here's a list of the technical aspects and contributions to the project:

- **3D Modeling:** Designed the characters, a 3D replica of the map Skild, and 30+ probs using Blender features like UV texturing, modifiers, and modeling tools.
- **Scripting:** Developed scripts to implement features like first-person movement, tasks manager, and interaction systems (tasks, reporting, and sabotaging) using C# and Unity3D environment.
- **Animation:** Produced character animations (Idle, Walking, Killing, Interacting) for smooth movement and interactions.
- **Texturing:** Applied 50+ textures to models to enhance visual appeal.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:** Implemented core gameplay mechanics, including crew member tasks and impostor roles.
- **Sound Design:** Planned sound effects and ambient sounds to immerse players in the game world.
- **Multiplayer Integration:** In-progress work to enable both online and offline multiplayer modes.
- **Project Management:** Organized and managed the development process, tracking progress and milestones.
- **Continuous Learning:** Demonstrated a commitment to learning and skill development throughout the project.
